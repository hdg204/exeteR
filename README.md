# exeteR

This repository contains code and examples for making graphs in **ggplot** using the University of Exeter colour scheme and plot. The intended use is for conference presentations and posters using the University of Exeter branding. This has been produced according to https://brand.exeter.ac.uk/colour/

## Installation

Ensure that the following packages are installed: extrafont, tidyverse, ggplot2, showtext. Then, run

```
library(devtools)
source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdg204/exeteR/main/ex_theme.R")

This will make the following items available:

1 - ```ex_theme```, ```ex_green_theme```, and ```ex_dark_theme```, ggplot themes that set colour schemes and fonts for ggplots
